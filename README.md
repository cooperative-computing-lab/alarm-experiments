# Alarm Experiments

## Purpose: 
We are experimenting scheduling algorithms to allocate resources to workloads with widely different resources consumption between tasks.

## Usage:
Running `make {dataset}` where dataset is in {colmena, hypersweep, exponential, normal_large, normal_small, bimodal, trimodal, uniform_large, uniform_small} will generate respective results in `resources_analysis/{dataset}/`.

## Note:
4 levels of information: nothing -> number of classes -> tag for each task -> everything

# Alarm Experiments

## Purpose: 
We are trying to allocate resources to workloads with widely different resources consumption between tasks.

## Usage:
Running `make colmena` will generate figures and results/statistics of colmena run. Plots are in `resources_analysis/colmena/plots` and spreadsheet containing stats is in `resources_analysis/colmena/results`.
